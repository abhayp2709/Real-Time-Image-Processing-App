# Real-Time-Image-Processing-App
Introduction -Image processing is a critical aspect of modern technology, playing a significant role in fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, remote sensing, and multimedia systems. Real-time image processing is particularly valuable for applications requiring immediate feedback, such as surveillance systems, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles.

This project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of Python in developing a real-time image processing application. It employs OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to perform image manipulations, and Tkinter, a standard GUI library in Python, to provide an interactive user interface. Pillow, a Python Imaging Library fork, is utilized for efficient handling of image formats within the application.

 The primary goal of the project is to build an intuitive tool where users can seamlessly load images, apply various filters, and save the modified outputs. By combining the power of OpenCV's computational efficiency with Tkinter's ease of use, the project delivers a real-time, interactive experience for users exploring image processing techniques.
